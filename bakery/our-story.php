                I John Mason founder of the Masonry Bakery started my culinary journey in my early adult hood when I got a 
                sourdough starter kit for Christmas. It was a gift from my parents and thanks to them I now have managed to 
                build a baking empire. I still remember my first sourdough loaf I baked with it being a long and painful 
                process due to having a week nurturing and growing my starter in addition to the day it came to baking the 
                bread. I remember it being a frustrating experience because the dough was too sticky, and it became 
                impossible to kneed. It took the whole day but in the end I came out with a loaf of bread that came out 
                being super tasty and I was proud of it. In the months that followed I would practice my baking skills and 
                became good at baking loaves and would bake one every weekend and sometimes multiple and gift to family 
                members or gift for special occasions. I even learnt that bread wasn't just the only thing I could make with 
                my sourdough starter and went on to make cookies, bagels, crumpets, banana bread, biscuits, and crackers.

                I took the next step in my baker career when I was told by my athletics coach to have a stall at a market in 
                Bridgenorth. It was an outstanding success and midday I had sold all of my stock and received superb feedback 
                from all customers saying my goods were delicious and that they'd be coming back. For the following months I 
                would balance my athletics, job as an application developer, university alongside preparing stock and baking 
                in preparation for the market on a Sunday. Each week my stall would be bustling with people and stock would 
                always sell out.

                    I decided that I should pursue my career as a baker and opened my first bakery: The Masonry Bakery with the 
                    help of my partner in the high street of Shrewsbury. We would sell sourdough goodies such as breads, rolls, 
                    banana breads, bagels, crumpets, and sweet treats such as cronuts, donuts, cookies, and brownies. Fortunately, 
                    the decision to pursue the career as a baker was successful and the bakery was regularly selling stock and 
                    footfall was at an all time high. We continued to work on our brand over the next few years and became the 
                    best bakery in Shrewsbury with people coming to Shrewsbury just to try out baked goods which is surreal as 
                    my love for baking started thanks to a Christmas gift from my parents.

                    After a few years of solidifying the brand we decided that we would like to expand our brand and company into 
                    a wider market and opened a bakery in Birmingham high street. Because of our work solidifying our brand and 
                    in addition to a strong social media presence the Birmingham store was an outstanding success, and the Masonry 
                    Bakery was growing as a brand and becoming a name people knew and sought out our products.

                    Due to our success a year after our expansion into Birmingham we opened two more stores in Leeds and London. 
                    So far after a year we have had outstanding success and people continue to enjoy our goods. One thing we 
                    believe is key to our success is the quality of our products. We ensure that every bit of baking we do is 
                    done to the highest quality and won't put anything out for customers unless it reaches our high standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for our future as a company we hope to grow with the success we are receiving and have received since we 
                    opened our first bakery in Shrewsbury and will look to expand to more cities when it makes sense for the 
                    company as we look to grow our brand but ensure our quality is retained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you to everyone who has been on this journey with us so far and we look forward to seeing where the future 
                    leads.
